## Notes

Since I don't own a macintosh I had to turn my desktop into a Hackintosh and run Xcode from there. The whole process of making a Hackintosh as well as installing Xcode onto it took about two days of work. After I got Xcode working, I created the basic version of the app pretty quickly but the most challenging thing was ironing out the bugs for the Settings View, more specifically while implementing the different theme options.
